            Use these resources to help you create a media gallery that has some kind of theme, for example:
            "dogs," "nature," "food", "art", "life during COVID-19," etc. If you're not feeling creative, then create a
            media gallery to showcase things you love about the place you're currently living.
        </p>
        <p>
            Please include the following components in your gallery:

            <li>A few images</li>
            <li>An IFrame (embedded Tweets, songs, videos, etc.)</li>
            <li>Some hyperlinks to related content on the internet</li>
        </ol>

            We haven't gone over CSS yet, but we can try doing some of these things as 
            a class!
