In tutorial this week, we're going to practice using `for...of` loops and templates to create "data-driven" interfaces that are responsive to the user. Part 1 is recommended. Part 2 is optional (if you're interested in basic JavaScript animations), and is recommended for more experienced programmers.

## Relevant to Homework

### 01-unique-messages
Using a for/of loop, print a message to each person listed in the names list.

### 02-unique-messages-objects
Using a for/of loop, write out each person’s avatar, name, and score, based on “people” list (of objects).

### 03-unique-messages-template-literal
Using a for/of loop and a template literal, write out each person’s avatar, name, and score, based on the people array.

### 05-gallery-revision
Modify the loadCards function so that it uses a for / of loop to generate a card for each photo in the list.

### 06-gallery-ajax
Update the loadCars() and loadBikes() functions so that they loads photos from the cars and bikes data files (respectively).
