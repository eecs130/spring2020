For the last 3 class meetings -- and in tutorial this week -- we will be prioritizing your final project and the skills and ideas that will help you complete your milestones.

## Part 1: Breakout Groups
Here is an <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KDHKtdWfy6zb7179NqPqnlsoCxAARj1hWeGiISK_n9E/edit#" target="_blank">activity document</a>, which includes group assignments, as well as suggestions for topics to discuss and challenges to work through. Please use this time to get feedback from your classmates and to figure out some concrete next steps -- whether new screens to build or finding resources to help you to learn what you still need to learn. At the end of this class period, we will decide as a class how to use the next two class meetings and tutorial on Friday.
