---


CSS is notoriously a nightmare -- particularly when it comes to layouts. As an effort to provide some guidance re: using some more modern techniques for layout, the course staff and I have created a basic CSS tutorial, where multiple layouts can be easily supported using CSS Grid -- the latest in a long line of strategies for simplifying layouts.

### Instructions
Please implement these three layouts (below) using CSS Grid. You should use the same stylesheet for all three views. Start with the HTML in

## What to turn in
To submit this week's Tutorial assignment (encouraged but not required if you attended Tutorial), please do the following: 

1. Save all of your Tutorial 3 files in a folder called `tutorial03`
2. Add your `tutorial03` folder to your git repository, commit them, and push them to github. Yout commands should look something like this:

```shell
$ git add tutorial03
$ git commit -am "Checking in my tutorial03 folder"
$ git push
```

When you're done, paste a link to your tutorial03 GitHub pages on Canvas under the Tutorial 3 assignment.
