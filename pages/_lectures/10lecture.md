Today we will begin examining JavaScript, and will therefore need to learn a little bit of programming. We will begin by practicing how to programmatically manipulate the DOM (in a way that is very similar to using CSS selectors). You will have on JavaScript and the DOM this week.

I have also assigned you a series of JavaScript videos from O'Reilly media that I highly recommend that you watch if you are new to JavaScript and the DOM.
