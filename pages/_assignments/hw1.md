<style>
    .preview-image {
        width: 500px;
        border-radius: 4px;
        border: solid 1px #CCC;
        padding: 5px 10px;

With respect to interface design, Layouts are, hands-down, one of the most difficult things to accomplish in CSS.

## Part 1: CSS Grid exercise
**Skills practice**: Understanding the rules of CSS Grid

## Part 2: Flexbox exercise
**Skills practice**: Understanding the rules of flexbox

## Part 3: Create a principled visual design

1. Open the following <a href="https://codepen.io/vanwars/pen/vYOGbmL?editors=1000" target="_blank">Codepen</a>. You can either fork it and register for CodePen to save it, or download the files and edit them using a code editor.
2. Select a header and a body copy font from <a href="https://fonts.google.com/" target="_blank">Google Fonts</a>. Here is some <a href="https://codepen.io/vanwars/pen/gOpryzO?editors=0100" target="_blank">sample code</a> of how this is done.
3. Instantiate the principles of **proximity** and **alignment** to create nice photo cards that flow. Consider using flexbox (see <a href="https://codepen.io/vanwars/pen/EJQwej?editors=0100" target="_blank">this sample</a>).
4. Modify the HTML / CSS so that there is one featured photo. Use the principle of **contrast** to make it stand out.
5. When you're done, paste a link to your file (ideally on CodePen) in <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fA4H-EnNbrQYhrsWHYniG6vUECCbwXsSmd2cgKitb_0/edit" target="_blank">this Google Doc</a> so that we can take a look at different techniques. You will continue working on this next week, so make sure you keep track of your files.

### Tips & Notes
* Use a grid
* Use whitespace liberally
* Play around with different font weights (and choose a font that supports many weights).
* Try not to use any borders. Let the whitespace shape the sections.
* Decide what is foreground and what is background and design accordingly.
* See lessons 5 & 6 for more details
* Note: if you want to change out these photos / subheaders in the HTML to something that is more interesting to you, feel free to do so.
